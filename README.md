## Development

To get started, ensure you have `node` and `yarn` installed. Then install
node modules via `yarn install`.

### Running the Development Server

Use `yarn start:development` to run the development server. Open the server
page at `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Most changes to files will
automatically be loaded into the browser. Adding CSS files will require a
restart to the server.

### Running Specs

Use `yarn test` to run the specs. They will run in a headless Chrome
instance.

To run specs continuously and re-run on file changes, use `yarn test:watch`.

To view the specs in a non-headless browser, use `yarn test:head` and `yarn
test:head:watch`.
